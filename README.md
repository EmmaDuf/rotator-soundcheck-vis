# rotator-soundcheck-vis
We use a couple custom VIs to achieve a loop over a given text file of coordinates, and to communicate with our control library.

These are written in LabView, then committed to Git.

There are pretty stable, haven't changed in a long time. But occasionally SoundCheck changes their code and these custom VIs are required to be recompiled. Basically just open them with the proper version of LabView and then save them. The SoundCheck documentation usually has a guide on this.
